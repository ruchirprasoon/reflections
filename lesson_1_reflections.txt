How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped as it presented the two versions right in front of me to compare. 
It would've been very cumbersome to do it manually otherwise where I would have to 
compare each line manually. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would help me track changes and which change led to an improvment or broke the system

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
